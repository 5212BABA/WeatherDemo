# Demo Weather Report App

This app is designed to demonstrate the ease with which an interactive web app can be built using the Actor Model.

This app is written in Scala using the [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/) and [Akka-Actor](https://akka.io/) frameworks.

See the presentation [Using the Actor Model](./documentation/Using%20the%20Actor%20Model.ppsx) in the documentation folder for a detailed description.
